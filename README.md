# dynamicserver
A system to dynamically launch DigitalOcean droplets as Minecraft servers if people are trying to connect, and destroys them when there's nobody on the server to save running costs. A "launch on demand" model similar to [toffer/minecloud](https://github.com/toffer/minecloud), except instead of using a web browser, everything can be interacted with through the Minecraft multiplayer server list. You can see the status of the server on the server list, and connect to it if it's not running to start it. No browser required, and configuration is done through .json files, so no database required either.
